Woofus is a turntable.fm chat bot written using Alain Gilbert's node.js turntable API.

The bot is retired, and I'm not sure that it even works anymore. RIP Woofus!

Some achievements of woofus (a eulogy, if you will):

1) First bot on turntable.fm to have "disco mode" (I'm proud of this one)
2) First bot to channel a traditional chat bot for a 'personality'
3) (one of the) First bots to control several other bots from a single bot script
4) First bot to automatically follow its owner between rooms
5) First bot (as far as I know) to interface with last.fm to retrieve song/artist metadata
6) All around sassy motherfucker.
